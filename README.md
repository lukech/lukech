### Hi there 👋, I'm lukech

I'm a __Release Manager__ at MongoDB who loves open source software, system automation, and cycling 🚴.

- 🐯 I've been managing __WiredTiger__ and __MongoDB__ releases from Sydney, Australia, since 2017. 
- 🧰 Tools and technologies I enjoy playing with
  - Python 🐍
  - Linux 🐧
  - Vim & VSCode 💚
  - Git & Github 🔖
  - Evergreen CI 🌲

MongoDB is an industry leading general-purpose database, with WiredTiger equipped as its underlying storage engine. And yes, both of them are open source softwares! We are more than happy to accept code contribution from the community.
